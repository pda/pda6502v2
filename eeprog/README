eeprog
======

`eeprog` is an In-Circuit Serial Programmer (ICSP) program for the pda6502v2.

It uses an FTDI FT230XQ on a [MicroFTX breakout board](https://jim.sh/ftx/) to
write data to the CAT25M01 SPI EEPROM on the pda6502v2 via the ICSP header. The
MicroFTX/FT230XQ was chosen because it's the simplest USB-to-SPI-capable device
I had lying around.

Developed on macOS, there's an `env` file for pointing clang (and vim linters)
at the homebrew-installed `libftdi` library/headers.
